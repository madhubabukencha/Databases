In MySQL, commands or statements can be broadly grouped into several categories based on their functionality. 
Here are the main groups:

1. **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
   These commands are used to define and manage database structures.
   - `CREATE`: To create databases, tables, indexes, etc.
   - `ALTER`: To modify the structure of an existing database object (like a table).
   - `DROP`: To delete objects from the database.
   - `TRUNCATE`: To remove all records from a table (but keeps the table structure).
   - `RENAME`: To rename a database object (e.g., a table).

2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML):**
   These commands are used to manipulate data in the database.
   - `SELECT`: To retrieve data from the database.
   - `INSERT`: To insert data into a table.
   - `UPDATE`: To update existing data in a table.
   - `DELETE`: To delete data from a table.

3. **Data Control Language (DCL):**
   These commands are used to control access to the data.
   - `GRANT`: To give user privileges.
   - `REVOKE`: To remove user privileges.

4. **Transaction Control Language (TCL):**
   These commands are used to manage transactions in the database.
   - `COMMIT`: To save the current transaction.
   - `ROLLBACK`: To undo the current transaction.
   - `SAVEPOINT`: To set a savepoint within a transaction.
   - `SET TRANSACTION`: To specify transaction behavior.

5. **Administrative Commands:**
   These are special commands used for database administration.
   - `SHOW`: To display the current status of the database or system variables.
   - `DESCRIBE (DESC)`: To show the structure of a table.
   - `USE`: To select a database for subsequent operations.
   - `EXPLAIN`: To display how a query will be executed or optimized.
   - `FLUSH`: To clear or reload internal caches (e.g., FLUSH PRIVILEGES).
   - `REPAIR TABLE`: To fix corrupted tables

6. **Utility Commands:**
   These are used for utility operations like loading or dumping data.
   - `LOAD DATA INFILE`: To load data from a file into a table.
   - `SELECT INTO OUTFILE`: To write the result of a query into a file.

7. **Session Control Language: (SCL)**
   - `SET`: This is often used to modify session variables (e.g., `SET autocommit = 0;`).
   - `RESET`: To reset the session state.
   - `SHOW SESSION STATUS`: To display session-specific information.
   - `OPTIMIZE TABLE`: To reclaim unused space or reorganize data.

Each group has its own purpose, making MySQL a powerful tool for managing databases.
